# Rubiks Cube Timer

This is a Rubik's Cube Timer that is coded in pygame/python which is functional and useful (if you solve Rubik's Cubes, that is...)! It is also useful as a simple stopwatch app (if you don't solve Rubik's Cubes) that gives you averages, and the best and worst times if you need!
